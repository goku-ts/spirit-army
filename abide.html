                  <p><strong>John 15:9 ISV As the Father loves me, so I also love you. So abide in my love.</strong></p>
                  <p>Sometimes, accepting what we feel we don't deserve can make us feel unworthy and guilty.</p>
                  <p>God's love goes beyond our understanding. It is a mystery. When we feel most undeserving of His
                     love,
                     that’s when He sees us as most deserving.
                     <strong> Romans 5:8 But God shows His love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died
                        for us.</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Father loves me, so I also love you... As long as the Father loves Jesus, Jesus loves me.
                     Will the Father ever stop loving Jesus? No. So will Jesus ever stop loving us? No.</p>
                  <p>Jesus reassures His disciples that His love for them is not based on their actions, but on His
                     Father’s love for Him.
                     Their part is to learn to abide in His love.</p>
                  <p>His love is <strong>unconditional</strong>. However, abiding in His love depends on us. Verse 10
                     says,
                     "If you keep my commandments, you will stay in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s
                     commandments and stay in His love."</p>
                  <p>What is the commandment?
                     <strong>John 13:34 NIV “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved
                        you,
                        that you also love one another.”</strong>
                  </p>
                  <P>Loving one another is our way of abiding in His love for us.</P>
                  <p>It can be hard to love those who have hurt us, right? Of course, it is. We don’t have the strength
                     on our own to love one another. <strong>1 John 4:19 says, "We love because He first loved
                        us."</strong>
                     Our strength and ability to love each other is rooted in His unconditional love for us.</p>
                  <p><strong>Because Jesus loves me, I can love.</strong></p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Prayer :</strong> <br>
                     Lord, thank you for loving me unconditionally. You look beyond my weaknesses and love me either
                     way.
                     I accept your love for me and i ask that you will help me stay in this love, by helping me to love
                     others.
                     Give me the grace to love like you do. Let your love overflow in my life, so it extends through me
                     to those around me.
                     Thank you Lord for answering me, because of your love for me. Amen
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Acknowledge:</strong><br>
                     I am deeply loved by the Father.<br>
                     His love shines upon me.<br>
                     I am able to love because of His love for me.<br>
                     His love is my trademark !
